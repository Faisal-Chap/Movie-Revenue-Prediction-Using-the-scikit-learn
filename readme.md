# 🎬 Movie Budgets vs. Box Office Revenue

> 📅 Day 78 of My Python & Data Science Journey

Can bigger movie budgets buy bigger box office success?  
This project explores that question using real-world data and machine learning.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

---

## 📊 Highlights

✅ Cleaned messy currency + date data  
✅ Visualized budget vs. revenue trends  
✅ Built a regression model  
✅ Predicted revenue for a $350M film  
✅ Compared insights between old and new films

---

## 🤖 Model Output (Old Films)

- **Slope**: 1.65  
- **Intercept**: \$22,821,538  
- **R² Score**: 0.03

➡️ Weak relationship: Budget ≠ guaranteed success for older films.

## 🔮 Prediction

> 🎥 \$350M Budget → Predicted Revenue ≈ **\$600M–\$700M**

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Model modern films  
- Add genre, studio, and release year  
- Try interactive charts (Plotly, Dash)
